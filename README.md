#This file elaborates on the scripts and datasets used for analaysis #The pipeline used for this study comprises of four main steps 

#Step 1: Step 1 involves scoring domains and protein sequences. Scripts are available in Github_scripts/1.github_Scoring_Domains_and_Sequence Datasets available in shared link Github_datasets/1.github_Scoring_Domains_and_Sequence

#Step 2: Step 2 involves constucting unified biological networks for host and pathogen Scripts are available in Github_scripts/2.github_network_building Datasets available in shared link Github_datasets/2.github_network_building

#Step 3: Step 3 involves computing network parameters including centrality metrics of the assembled networks Scripts are available in Github_scripts/3.github_computing_network_parameters Datasets available in shared link Github_datasets/3.github_computing_network_parameters

#Step 4: Step 4 involves performing network structural and functional analysis Scripts are available in Github_scripts/4.github_network_clustering_Analysis Datasets available in shared link Github_datasets/4.github_network_clustering_Analysis

#Step 5: Step 5 Involves identifyingn disease similary and repurpoasble drugs using implicit semantic Scripts are available in Github_scripts/5.github_semantic_similarity Datasets available in shared link Github_datasets/5.github_semantic_similarity
